2018-03-10 11:25:02 8888  [WARNING] Warning: One or more nets are completely unrouted.  Do you want to connect them using "virtual", Manhattan-style routing?  (Does not apply to power-supply nets.)  Note: This process will begin by determining the detailed routing status of every net on the board, which can be very time-consuming (especially if some power-supply nets are mistakenly identified as signal nets).  If you prefer to skip this process now, you can run it later using Edit > Connect Nets with Manhattan Routing. - The "No" button was selected

2018-03-10 11:25:23 8888  [WARNING] Graphics-rendering performance may be impaired.  Reason: Your OpenGL driver does not claim to support vertex buffer objects.  Vertex buffer objects improve rendering performance by taking better advantage of the graphics hardware. Without them, rendering is forced to use slower OpenGL capabilities.  Your current OpenGL driver claims support of OpenGL v1.1. Updating your OpenGL driver may resolve the problem. However, remote desktop and some virtual machines are known not to support vertex buffer objects.
